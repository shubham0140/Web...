        A full adder is a digital circuit that performs addition.  Full adders are implemented with logic gates in hardware.
        A full adder adds three one-bit binary numbers, two operands and a carry bit. The adder outputs two numbers, a sum and a carry bit.
        The term is contrasted with a half adder, which adds two binary digits.
